    <h1>What I have Learned about GitHub</h1>
    <p>GitHub repositories, branches, and commits are key parts of version control. A repository is where all the project files and their history are stored. Branches allow developers to work on different versions of a project at the same time, and commits record specific changes made to files with notes describing what was updated. For my website project, I used one main repository and didn’t create any separate branches since I only worked on one version. I made commits as I updated and improved my files, which helped me save my progress, track what I changed, and keep my project organized throughout development.
